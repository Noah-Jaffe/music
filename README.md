# music
musicplayer hosted by github ecosystem :D

# idea
the idea is to load the source urls into a file (how you get those source urls can be customized, see below for how i do it)
then the musicplayer.html file should be able to read from it to know which songs to play.

### how i get source urls:
github actions that run periodically to update our song list.
